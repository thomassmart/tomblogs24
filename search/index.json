[{"content":"You know what they say: the only thing that grows faster than an organisation, is the number of vulnerabilities. I see plenty of organisations claim they know their threat vectors, and sure, you may have software and hardware designed to keep intruders out, but what about all those IoT devices and cloud services you rely on? And how about third-party apps and other assets that access sensitive data? Don\u0026rsquo;t even get started on the issues that can araise from Shadow IT! The attack surface of an organization is constantly expanding, so it\u0026rsquo;s critical to manage it with External Attack Surface Management (EASM). To help you do just that, Azure has a tool that can be used to discover, monitor and assess the external surface of your organisation with Defender for EASM. Defender for EASM will help you reduce risk by identifying potential vulnerabilities in your external environment so your security team can prioritize them based on severity or likelihood of exploitation.\nThe expanding attack surface The attack surface of an organisation is the sum of all possible paths that an attacker can use to reach a system. For example, if you have a web server that runs on port 80 and you also have an internal database server that runs on port 1521, then there are two different paths an attacker can take in order to get access to your network: either directly through the web server or indirectly through the database server.\nThe attack surface of your organization expands over time as new systems are added to your network, but it also grows as new applications are deployed within it. If someone puts up a few web apps for internal use only (for example), these will still be part of your attack surface even though they\u0026rsquo;re not accessible from anywhere else online!\nAttack Vectors If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the term ‚Äúattack vector,‚Äù it is the way an attacker can get into a system. You may be thinking that sounds like something from a sci-fi movie, but it‚Äôs actually true! This is different from Attack surface as vectors are the methods that are exploited to gain access.\nAttack vectors are constantly expanding: modern attacks often use multiple attack vectors simultaneously. The external attack surface of a system is the part of it that is exposed to the internet and thus vulnerable to attack. In other words, more things are connected to networks now than ever before (think IoT devices) and they\u0026rsquo;re all potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks as well.\nThe process of managing this expanding external attack surface is known as External Attack Surface Management (EASM). EASM involves identifying what parts of your systems are exposed and then taking steps to minimize those risks by reducing their exposure while still allowing them access when needed.\nExternal Attack Surface Management and Defender for EASM. Attack surface management (ASM) is a key element in Defender for EASM (EASM), a core component of the Defender Security Platform. ASM is about understanding and reducing your external attack surface by identifying, assessing and reporting on vulnerabilities associated with all systems, services, applications and data that are exposed to the internet.\nDefender EASM helps you monitor your organisation\u0026rsquo;s external attack surfaces through the use of EASM‚Äîan extensive list of thousands of predefined industry best practice checks that are constantly updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered or reported. With this information at hand, you can take action to reduce your risk profile by making informed decisions about which resources should be locked down or removed entirely from the internet‚Äîallowing you to focus on what really matters: internal security.\nYou can better protect your enterprise by managing your external attack surface with Defender for EASM.\nWhy monitor EASM? - Surely an annual audit is sufficient? Think of your enterprise like a castle: you need to make sure that no one can get in. And while there are many things you can do and good practices you should follow to keep intruders out, it is also important to know what vulnerabilities exist and how they could be exploited by an attacker.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where Defender for EASM comes in. It is a key component of the Defender for EASM solution, which helps provide a unified view of your external attack surface by identifying and managing vulnerabilities across all endpoints‚Äîvirtual machines (VMs), laptops, desktops, mobile devices‚Äîthat connect with the internet or any untrusted network.\nWrapping it up The attack surface of an organization is constantly expanding. New technologies, applications and networks are being added every day, making it harder for defenders to keep up with the pace at which threats are evolving. Attackers have been one step ahead of defenders by finding new vulnerabilities and exploiting them before anyone knows about them. Defender for EASM helps you detect these vulnerabilities before attackers do in your network, so you can take action on them quickly before they cause damage or become exploited by malware or other cyber threats.\nLinks Ok, I\u0026rsquo;m interested, give me those links\nDefender EASM Overview\n","date":"2022-10-26T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://tomsmart.au/p/defender-easm/","title":"Watch out, there are vulnerabilities about üßê"},{"content":"Subscription\u0026rsquo;s are king It\u0026rsquo;s been a fundamental shift that\u0026rsquo;s occurred over the recent decades. Gone are the days of paying once for something, now we\u0026rsquo;re offered the opportunity to continually pay for things that we once owned outright. Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s not without benefits, but rarely do you now \u0026lsquo;own\u0026rsquo; a software license or \u0026lsquo;buy\u0026rsquo; a server.\nWhy the change to a renter\u0026rsquo;s market? There\u0026rsquo;s a few reason\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s occurred:\nLow, or no, initial CapEx Predicable bills, based on consumption Economies of scale for technology enablement Shared responsibility, those best placed to manage the items are the ones tasked with the job. New features are often included. The vendor can afford a development team to work on the product with their own predictable income. Maintenance is often included, see above point. The pricing can often be per user or per seat based. This can make it more competitive for the smaller and medium businesses. Large and Enterprise have the buying power of negotiation still. Products can be split into multiple tiers or add-ons. Rather than having to pay for the entire product, you can software unlock additional features. Aside from the market jargon, there is a wealth of technical features that can be unlocked. Teams can gain access to technology that was either beyond the capacity to setup and manager, or just plain too expensive.\nExample, few organisation ran Skype for Business. Evolving from UCS -\u0026gt; Lync -\u0026gt; Skype for business the product team worked for years to try and land the technology into their customers premises, but it was too expensive. The servers required to run it were too complex and numerous, and the skill set required to administer and build sparse. The integration was there, the functionality was there, the marketing was there but it just never stuck.\nMicrosoft launched Teams (SaaS) and it has evolved to become on their best success stories. Recent information shows that they are at 230 million daily active users. 90% of the Fortune 500 have adopted it. During the COVID-19 pandemic, its growth has been rumoured to have caused availability constraints within Azure as the product was expanding quicker than hardware could be procured. Why? It cost nothing for existing subscriptions. Add-on\u0026rsquo;s were available to unlock greater functionality, setup was simple.\nWhat in the aaS? Confusion sets in as the subscription model marketing takes flight. In an attempt to make the offering more understandable, a catchy phrase was needed. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) initially paved the way. Rather than running databases, scoping sizing requirements and hosting application servers, why not leave all that hard work to the vendor? They run all the infrastructure that\u0026rsquo;s required to make run the app. Not only just the infrastructure, they are responsible for the entire stack. The customer responsibility was often limited to access, and data. You need to define who has access to what, and the data is stored in the correct location, and treated in alignment with organisational policy.\nGreat Success. We have take off. üõ´ Accountants initially gripe at the loss their standard Capex accounting methods, but the bill predictability and scalability take hold. Now what? Seeing the success of SaaS, vendors starting coining the idea, and extending the product offerings.\nInfrastructure-as-a-Service, IaaS, was the next cab off the rank. Rather than buy expensive server hardware, arrange a secure and reliable data centre and manage hardware failures and warranties, IaaS was the answer! Vendors everywhere started to offer Virtual Machines that you could purchase. Pick a size, design a network, and away you go. Want backups? No problem we\u0026rsquo;ve got an add-on for that. Want replication, again - no problems, we\u0026rsquo;ve got an add-on. Sys Admins rejoice, as disk failures and capacity management become a battle scar of your IT career. A simple project no longer became the catalyst for a hardware refresh or procurement exercise. IaaS isn\u0026rsquo;t as easy going as SaaS however. It\u0026rsquo;s still on you to keep the OS/Apps up-to-date, ensure that the system is working well.\nSeeing that these items are at different ends of a scale, its easy to understand why Platform-as-a-Service was derived. PaaS really unlocks organisation to focus on what they are good at, whilst still having the flexibility to run what they need. Need an SQL database, most businesses do - few business have a full time DBA though. Perhaps that database is relatively small, but still critical infrastructure. Suddenly an SQL farm, in multiple geo locations, and other requirements mean that this tiny DB is now costing thousands of dollars. PaaS allows you to have the flexibility to use consumption based pricing, and choose those items important to you. Because the vendor needs to setup the platform to cater to a wide range of scenarios, and the fact it will likely multitenant solution, they are able to unlock complex architecture for a fraction of the price. This flexibility is a testament to the economics of scale.\nThe shared responsibility model Microsoft have already written well about the responsibility by stakeholder against different as a service offerings. Its a short read, but will really empower your understanding of who is responsible when\nSimple Please Acronym Actual Model Description Example SaaS Software as a Service Software that you purchase in an ongoing manner, most items are managed by the vendor Office365, Sales Force, etc PaaS Platform as a Service Key components that you can consume, interact or program with. You\u0026rsquo;re not responsible for the management/maintenance of the platform/os, but the app that it may interact with Azure SQL, Azure Functions IaaS Infrastructure as a Service Low level components, storage, computer, networks. You don\u0026rsquo;t worry about hardware, but that\u0026rsquo;s about it. Azure Virtual Machines Where to from here? There\u0026rsquo;s no doubt that more layers of cake will be added. The as-a-service model will undoubtedly, and is, expanding. Desktop-As-A-Service (DaaS) is already taking hold with the likes of Azure Virtual Desktop and W365 Cloud PC. Some service offerings will be a flash in the pan, but there\u0026rsquo;s the chance the next revolution is around the corner. Best to keep the eyes and mind open.\nDay 3 of üíØ.

Before getting stuck into this post, if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this after April 22, it\u0026rsquo;s probably now out of date. Azure\u0026rsquo;s footprint is constantly expanding and being innovated upon.\nBest to read the Microsoft documentation, or check out the interactive global infrastructure map\nMicrosoft\u0026rsquo;s global azure reach is impressive. Microsoft boast that it has more global regions than any other cloud provider. The footprint is constantly evolving as the technologies are being aggressively adopted. What is also interesting is the exploration into other ways of providing these data centre\u0026rsquo;s. A favorite, and easy conversation starter, is their experiments into underwater data centres\nAvailability Zone Within an Azure region are availability zones. Each availability zone, sometimes referred to as AZ\u0026rsquo;s, is made up of one or more data centers that are powered, cooled, and networked independently. This is important as these az\u0026rsquo;s serve as an isolation boundary. If one zone fails, the other continues to function. High-speed, private fiber-optic networks connect the availability zones, this allows for most applications to access near real-time replication.\nBy co-locating your computing, storage, networking, and data resources inside a zone and replicating into other zones, availability zones can be used to operate mission-critical applications and embed high-availability into your application architecture. However, duplicating your services and transmitting data between zones may come at a cost.\nAzure Regions What\u0026rsquo;s a region? Simply, a geographically close collection of three availability zones. There are governing items that define a region, including a latency of less than 2ms between DCs as well as physical distance. It\u0026rsquo;s worthwhile noting that not all regions offer all services. As regions grow, and scale out, services are enabled. These regions allow apps and infrastructure to have a global or local presence as required.\nWhen you deploy a resource, you\u0026rsquo;ll frequently be asked to choose the region in which you want the resource to be provisioned. You maybe asked to define redundancy, which I\u0026rsquo;ll cover off in another post, and this is where it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand these differences.\nSpecial Regions Azure has specialised regions that you might want to use when you build out your applications for compliance or legal purposes. A few examples include:\nUS DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These regions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for U.S. government agencies and partners. These data centers are operated by screened U.S. personnel and include additional compliance certifications. China East, China North, and more: These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly maintain the data centers. Region Pairs One or more data centers are used to create availability zones. Within a single region, there\u0026rsquo;s at least three zones. A massive natural disaster could cause an outage large enough to affect perhaps two data centers. This is why Azure also creates region pairs.\nEach Azure region will always be matched with another region with the same geography (such as the Australia, United States, Europe, or Asia) which is at least 500 kilometres away. This strategy enables for the replication of resources (such as VM storage) across a geography, which helps minimise the likelihood of interruptions caused by events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that strike both locations at the same time. If one of the regions in a pair was hit by a natural disaster, for example, services would instantly failover to the other area in the pair.\nYou may use the pair of areas to provide reliable services and data redundancy because they are directly connected and far enough apart to be isolated from regional catastrophes. Using region pairings, several services provide automatic geo-redundant storage.\nAlso, If there is a widespread Azure outage, one region from each pair is prioritised to ensure that at least one region is restored as soon as practicable for applications hosted in that region pair. Microsoft also use the region pairs to minimise downtime and the possibility of application outages, planned Azure changes are rolled out to paired regions one area at a time.\nAdditional Resources Style Link Visual Learner John Savill - Understanding Microsoft Azure Availability Zones!
