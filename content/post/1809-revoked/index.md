That's right, Microsoft have just announced the [removal of the 1809 October release of Windows 10.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4464619)

There have been numerous [articles surfacing where users profiles were reset as part of the upgrade](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-1809-update-deleted-all-files-from/ff608374-2686-4a08-a4c2-caa4caa6d4e1
