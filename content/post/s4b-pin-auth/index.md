I was having issues with a desk phone (Specifically a Polycom VVX310 running 5.4.0.10182) signing in to Lync 2013 with Ext/Pin. When attempting auth the phone would simply return "Lync Sign in Failed". Pin Auth had been previously working and no changes to DNS or DHCP had been made and all certificates were valid.

I cranked up the logs on the device and still couldn't see any issues. It was grabbing the CA on boot and would contact Lync and get a webticket, however the following in the log raised an eyebrow.

~~~~~~~~~~~
 0202115811|tickt|*|00|m_validUntil [0]
 0202115811|tickt|*|00|m_validityDuration [0]
 0202115811|tickt|*|00|m_bCertExists [0]
 0202115811|tickt|*|00|m_bCertExpired [1]
 0202115811|tickt|*|00|m_eErrorCode [9]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doubting the HTTPS certificate on the certificate service, I opened and confirmed that it was still valid and trusted.

The next step was to test an alternate phone and an alternate site. Same issue. This points us back to the issue being Lync wide.

Luckily there are a few powershell cmdlets that we can use to test the web ticket service.

~~~~~~~~
Test-CSClientAuth
~~~~~~~~
 will allow us to test NTLM authentication against the web ticket service.

~~~~~~~~
Test-CSPhoneBootsrap
~~~~~~~~

 will allow us to test PIN/EXT auth against the web ticket service.

When testing these directly from your lync server you will need to fill out -TargetFqdn and -TargetURI to avoid DHCP lookups/failure. You can alternatively install the module on a PC that has DHCP and test from there.

Typical usage and responses for these cmdlets:

~~~~~~~~~~~

PS> Test-CsClientAuth -UserSipAddress USER@SIPDOMAIN -TargetFqdn LYNCSERVER.DOMAIN
cmdlet Test-CsClientAuthentication at command pipeline position 1

As you can see above, the reason reported back was invalid pin. In my case I wasn't getting a response from the web-ticket at all (Above shown as demonstration)

So the issue was with the web service not responding. I restarted the internal web service within IIS and tested again. This resolved the issue and users were able to use ext/pin sign in again.
